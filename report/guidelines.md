# Course Project Guidelines

> DA 225o Deep Learning (Summer 2025 Term)

- Topic selection: Completely open. The project must contain aspects of topics taught in the DA225o course. You can do a project in the spectrum from completely theory to completely applied, and anything in between. Try to select a project that excites your team and is useful for your final MTO dissertation project and/or relevant to your company currently.
- Team size: 5 to 7. Any project with fewer than 5 or more than 7 will be desk rejected, resulting in a 0 score.
- Final submission: A PDF in ECAI format with a maximum of 3 pages + references. The beginning of the 4th page must include contributions by the members of each team. You can include an appendix with unlimited pages. Projects that include a demo website/app and code in Github repo will receive more points than projects that do not have these elements.

You must include architecture diagrams, results in the form of tables, figures, include appropriately justified evaluation metric and evidence that you have followed the six step problem solving approach.
- We plan to manage the paper submission through Open Review, if everything goes as per plan. Else, we will default to MS Teams assignment.
    > We expect the date to register title and abstract to be June 7, and final paper submission by June 18, and reviews due by June 22. Instructors and TAs will do the review in the Week of June 23 to 27.
- Peer review: Each paper will be peer reviewed by two other individuals who are not in the team of the project. This peer review must include a critical assessment of the project and comment on all aspects mentioned in the bullet point 3 above.
- Evaluation:
    * Each paper will be rated out of 10 by two peer reviewers (other students in the class) and one TA
    * The instructor will do a meta review and decide the final score out of 10 based on the peer review.
    * Each student will also receive an individual contribution score out of 5 based on the difficulty of their contribution as determined by the depth of the project and the self declared contribution statement (average of one rating by one TA and one by instructor). The individual commits to the github repo can also serve as an indication for this scoring.
    * Each student will also receive another 5 points based on the quality of their review of another paper.
    * The scores of the group (same score for all members out of 10) and 5+5 individual scores will be summed to get the individual student's score out of 20 points for the course project.
    * Any evidence of plagiarism will result in 0 for all students involved in the team.
- Fair use of LLMs: You are free to use LLM for brainstorming, coding, co-pilot, grammar editing, writing content, etc. However, remember that the instructor and TAs are well-versed in identifying simple prompt-generated content and will give low scores for low effort.
- To help you discover team mates, we have posted the class enrollment (as on 24 May) in the shared MS Excel sheet. Please fill your company name and select the lowest available team number. The Excel sheet can be accessed only through your registered IISc email. The history management system will record every edit, and so if you do not play fair (e.g., you deleted some other student's information), you will get a fail grade for the course.
