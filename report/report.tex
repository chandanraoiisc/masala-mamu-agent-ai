\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Multi-Agent Architecture}

Masala Mamu employs a modular architecture comprised of specialized agents coordinated by a central routing mechanism. As illustrated in Figure 1, the system consists of:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex] % Use latex arrow style which is very clear

    % Draw the curved arrow first (will be behind everything)
    \draw[->, gray!70, thin] (0,-6.5) to[out=180,in=180] (0,0);

    % Define the nodes with opaque backgrounds and borders
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (user) at (0,0) {User Interface};
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (router) at (0,-2) {Query Router};
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (nutrition) at (-3,-4) {Nutrition Agent};
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (inventory) at (0,-4) {Inventory Agent};
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (price) at (3,-4) {Price Comparison};
    \node[rectangle, draw, fill=white, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm] (response) at (0,-6.5) {Response Generator};

    % Draw all other arrows on top with bold style
    \draw[->] (user) -- (router);
    \draw[->] (router) -- (nutrition);
    \draw[->] (router) -- (inventory);
    \draw[->] (router) -- (price);
    \draw[->] (nutrition) -- (response);
    \draw[->] (inventory) -- (response);
    \draw[->] (price) -- (response);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Multi-agent system architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Query Router:} Analyzes user queries and directs them to the appropriate specialized agent
    \item \textbf{Nutrition Analysis Agent:} Processes food-related queries and provides nutritional information
    \item \textbf{Price Comparison Agent:} Searches for the best grocery deals across e-commerce platforms
    \item \textbf{Inventory Management Agent:} Tracks kitchen ingredients and facilitates inventory queries
    \item \textbf{Response Generator:} Combines outputs from specialized agents to create cohesive responses
\end{itemize}

The orchestration layer, implemented with LangGraph, manages the workflow between agents, allowing for complex multi-step reasoning. This approach enables the system to handle queries that span multiple domains, such as: "What's the most cost-effective way to prepare a high-protein vegetarian meal?"

\subsection{Technology Stack}

The implementation leverages modern AI and web technologies:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{LLM Integration:} Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot)
    \item \textbf{Framework:} LangChain and LangGraph for agent orchestration and tool usage
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} Streamlit for interactive UI components and visualization dashboard
    \item \textbf{Data Storage:} SQLite for nutrition records, MongoDB Atlas for inventory management
    \item \textbf{Computer Vision:} GPT-4o Vision for ingredient recognition from images
    \item \textbf{Vector Embeddings:} Sentence-transformers for semantic search capabilities
    \item \textbf{Web Scraping:} Custom tools for real-time price comparison across e-commerce platforms
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Components}

\subsection{Nutrition Analysis System}

The nutrition analysis component provides detailed macro-nutrient information for ingredients and recipes. It leverages a combination of LLM reasoning and specialized databases to offer nutritional insights.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Nutrition Analysis Workflow}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Parse user query for food items
\State For each ingredient/recipe:
\State \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Search nutrition database
\State \hspace{\algorithmicindent} If not found, use LLM with search tools
\State Aggregate nutrition data and generate response
\State Store analysis in user history database
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The system maintains a historical record of nutrition queries, enabling trend analysis and personalized recommendations based on the user's dietary patterns. The visualization dashboard (Figure 2) presents this data through interactive charts, helping users track their macro-nutrient consumption over time.

\subsection{Price Comparison Engine}

The price comparison engine uses web scraping techniques to gather real-time pricing information from major Indian e-commerce platforms, including BigBasket, Amazon, Flipkart, and JioMart. The system employs:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Custom scraping tools optimized for Indian e-commerce platforms
    \item Price normalization algorithms to account for different packaging sizes
    \item Alternative product suggestions based on price and nutritional similarity
    \item Historical price tracking to identify trends and optimal purchase timing
\end{itemize}

The pricing data is presented in a comparative format, enabling users to make informed purchasing decisions based on both cost and nutritional value.

\subsection{Kitchen Inventory Management}

The kitchen inventory management module keeps track of available ingredients and their quantities to facilitate recipe planning and grocery shopping. It leverages:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Computer vision techniques to identify ingredients from uploaded images
    \item Vector embeddings for semantic search of inventory items
    \item MongoDB Atlas for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory data
    \item Streamlit interface for easy inventory management and querying
\end{itemize}

The system supports image-based inventory updates, where users can upload photos of groceries or receipts, and the system automatically identifies items using GPT-4o vision capabilities. Users can review and edit the detected items before adding them to their inventory. This streamlines the inventory management process and reduces manual data entry.

The RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) query system allows users to ask natural language questions about their inventory, such as "What ingredients do I have for making pasta?" or "Which vegetables are about to expire?" The system retrieves relevant inventory information and generates helpful responses using LLM reasoning.

\subsection{Interactive User Interface}

The system provides a conversational interface implemented with Streamlit, featuring:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Text-based interaction with the AI assistant
    \item Voice input/output capabilities for hands-free operation in kitchen environments
    \item Interactive nutrition dashboard with customizable visualization options
    \item Seamless switching between nutrition analysis and price comparison features
\end{itemize}

The interface is designed to be accessible and intuitive, allowing users to interact naturally with the system while cooking or planning meals.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Agent Implementation}

Each specialized agent follows a similar implementation pattern:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item A system prompt defining the agent's role and capabilities
    \item A set of specialized tools providing domain-specific functionality
    \item Input validation to ensure required parameters are provided
    \item Output formatting for consistent response structure
\end{itemize}

The nutrition agent, for example, is defined with a system prompt that emphasizes accuracy in nutritional information and includes tools for searching nutrition databases and performing calculations.

\subsection{Database Schema}

The nutrition tracking system utilizes a SQLite database with the following key tables:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{NutritionRecords:} Stores individual nutrition entries with timestamps
    \item \textbf{IngredientNutrition:} Contains nutrition data for individual ingredients
    \item \textbf{RecipeNutrition:} Stores aggregated nutrition information for complete recipes
    \item \textbf{UserPreferences:} Maintains user-specific nutrition goals and dietary restrictions
\end{itemize}

This schema enables efficient storage and retrieval of nutrition data while supporting trend analysis and personalized recommendations.

\subsection{Routing Logic}

The router agent employs a combination of keyword matching and semantic understanding to direct queries to the appropriate specialized agent. The routing algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Identifies key entities in the user query (food items, nutrition terms, price indicators)
    \item Calculates relevance scores for each specialized agent
    \item Routes the query to the highest-scoring agent or multiple agents if the query spans domains
    \item Manages context preservation between interactions
\end{enumerate}

This approach ensures that user queries are handled by the most appropriate agent while maintaining conversation coherence.
